# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v1.9.0

### Major Changes

### New Features and Improvements

### Bug Fixes

- Fix `AckCallback` notifications being silently dropped after a callback throws. An exception from `onAck` or `onError` was left pending on the SDK thread that ran the callback, so every later callback on that thread, including callbacks of other streams, failed without reaching Java. The exception is now cleared and logged at ERROR level with its stack trace through the SDK's SLF4J logger (visible when an SLF4J binding is configured), and later callbacks are delivered. Callbacks also no longer leave the thrown exception and the `onError` message referenced by native code after they return.

### Documentation

- Documented the GCP workspace URL and Zerobus endpoint formats. The formats for
  AWS, Azure, and GCP now live in one [connection URL
  table](https://github.com/databricks/zerobus-sdk/blob/main/README.md#1-connection-urls-and-workspace-id),
  and this SDK's README, examples, proto generator docs, and API docs link to it
  instead of repeating cloud-specific URLs.
