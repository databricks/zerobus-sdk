# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v2.12.0

### Major Changes

### New Features and Improvements

- Added the feature-gated `PersistentStream` API for creating durable ingestion
  streams and resuming them by `stream_id` from the last committed offset.

### Bug Fixes

### Documentation

### Internal Changes

- Extracted a private transport-generic mux core and lane contract. The gRPC
  mux keeps its existing behavior, while each lane owns its close and recovery
  paths.
- Added a stateful persistent-stream mock and integration coverage for create,
  flush, resume offset continuity, and unknown stream IDs.
