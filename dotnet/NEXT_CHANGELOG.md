# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v0.2.0

### New Features and Improvements

- JSON and protobuf streams now use a dedicated gRPC connection by default.
  Call `ZerobusSdk.CreateBuilder().ConnectionPerStream(false)` to share one
  HTTP/2 connection across streams.

### Deprecations

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a use-after-free in which a custom `IHeadersProvider` could be freed
  while the Rust core was still inside a `GetHeaders()` call into it during
  connection recovery. Provider ownership is now handed to the FFI via the new
  `free_user_data` destroy callback, which releases the provider's `GCHandle`
  only after any in-flight `GetHeaders()` has returned; the stream no longer
  frees the handle on dispose. This applies to both the synchronous
  (`CreateStreamWithHeadersProvider`) and asynchronous
  (`CreateStreamWithHeadersProviderAsync`) creation paths. Tracks the FFI
  signature change to `zerobus_sdk_create_stream_with_headers_provider` and
  `zerobus_sdk_create_stream_with_headers_provider_async`. No public API change.
- Fixed a race in stream disposal. The count of in-flight asynchronous operations
  and its "drained" signal were updated separately, so `Dispose()`,
  `DisposeAsync()`, `Close()` or `RecreateStream(...)` could treat the stream as
  drained while an asynchronous operation was still registered, and close or free
  the native stream while that operation could still use it.
- `ZerobusStream.DisposeAsync()` (and `await using`) no longer blocks the calling
  thread while asynchronous operations such as `FlushAsync()` are in flight; it
  awaits them, then closes the stream.

### Documentation

- Corrected installation and source-build prerequisites, separated JSON and
  protobuf stream examples, and added a runnable generated-message example.
- Documented the asynchronous ingestion model across the README, XML docs, and
  examples: ingest records in a loop, then call `Flush()` once instead of waiting
  for each record. `WaitForOffset()` is now presented as a targeted wait for a
  specific offset.
- Documented that `GetUnackedRecords()` can fail while the stream is still
  active after a flush timeout, and stopped reporting success after ingest
  failures. Pointed CONTRIBUTING at `src/Zerobus/Native/`.

### Internal Changes

- Made the .NET release workflow build-only, consistent with the other SDKs. It now packs the NuGet package and uploads it as an artifact; publishing and the GitHub Release happen downstream.
- Pin the full NuGet restore graph with `packages.lock.json` and fail CI restore when the lock files are stale (`RestoreLockedMode`).

### API Changes
